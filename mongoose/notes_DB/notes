//nosql=>mongoose
// ques-why mongoose?
//ans-used widely ,easy syntax
//command=>to check

      // moongos shell=>mongosh
      //exit=ctrl+c 2 times
      //show databse/dbs/databses
      //test>default db and no use of this
      //check for which db=>db -check current databse
      //use DB_Name i.e-use ShopApp to switch to db other and create new db

      //NEVER USE THIS COMMANDS IN THE DATABASE
      //to drop db->dp.dropDatabase()-it will remove this databse as we drop it so never use it


      //Ques->what is collection->
      //NOsql->INplace of table we have collection.
      //what is Document?
      //ANs-Each atomic entity inside a collection is a docu-dom and Db but this is for DB here for obejct 
      //docu-collection-db(nosql)


      //QUES->How data is stored in db
      //Ans->Not json but Bson(Binary Bson i.e in bit form ) because it faster than jason and occupy more space json 
      // json-it supports less basic datatypes, bson-it stores more basic datatypes


// mongoose is an object 
//connect accepts string only to provide the port for req and res
// which returns a promises- for resolve(.then) and it will reject (.catch) for connect -it is an method
//it will provide a ODM layer b/w server and mongoose


// ----------------------------------------------
//for the interect with my db for nosql ODM(Mongoose) -db collection(when interect with shell and everything is a document) &i used  Models(it is an js class this represents collection )
//In the mongoose shell i have creted i.e movies db in which i have created a collection for movies ie.name,imdb eTC
//But in the same i have for models but these r the js files collections


//In order to create a collection using schema(blueprint)
//as i cannot make models directl

//schema-> to model for js( & collection for shell)-db se connect krung.

//data -db mai json/bson m store krta h 
//server is sending the data to db i.e express.js i.e some js files  


// **** for server it have js file -ODM which convert these into json/bson file for db and from db-server usable js convert 
//ODM mongoose -it maps the data


//data -usable js obj-schema tells how the data will be mapped
// i.e {name:'raja'-it is a string
    // imdb:8,-it is a no
    //now schema decide the name-string and imdb-number


    //for the shell we get a automatically id by Mongodb
    //But in this mongoose will provide id for express

    //for express -we have mongoose
    //for shell -we have mongodb

    //  }




//for create this model we need a schema before model


//creation of schema mvp,mvc
//mvc=module view controller
//i have made modules folder in which Product.js a file

//schema and module are the part of mongoose so i will require it
//firstly i will make a schema in models folder

//route foleder for all the api's and templeates and req all that 



//lect-52
//Every single entity is a document jab bhi mai ek document/object add krunga MOngodb ,automatically us doc ke pass ek unique id generate hogi
//i.e-apple have unique id



//model for db stroring save() method 
//js method ki wjah s als s .save()
 krna pdha 
 //.save();
 //is automatically save for create() and insertMany()
