//to synchronise(means sbka code code har jgah nazar aye or reflect ho) the code of all the team project we use vcs

//vcs type-bit keeper,mercury,Git


//git story in this linux kernal-made by linuc and he made a open sourece in which every can contributes his/her edit code or bugs ..so he got more than 1k request from all then 2 of them made a git for this synchronise code

//Git have 2 version-Centralised vsc and distributes Git

//1.centralised vcs-
//1. code is present at one place & everybody who changes it directly get reflected
//2. we need online or net ex-google sheet
//3. No backup is available 

//2.Distributed Git
//1. code is present at a place & baki log copies that code and make their own change
//2. No net reuire
//3.Backup is available
