static files:-
i.e-.html,.css.js and images files are static files


//views-: it is an folder which contsins .ejs file for the render templates/pages/views

//public ->In this i will serve all my static files inside this folder and i can change this name also but convention-:(means as it good practice) not as it is good practice for reading and devlopment


//both used for providing path
//views-templates-app.set()
//public->staticfile->app.use(express.static())


//Get vs post
Get =>1.this should be used to fetch/retrive the date


//RESTful routing
//Representational State Transfer 
//->this is just a way/architectural style(way of writing)of
//routes to interface with client and server

//rest-RESTful-jab html,js,css ye page show krte hai exxample.
